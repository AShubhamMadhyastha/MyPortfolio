            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> I am a passionate web developer with a knack for creating beautiful and functional websites.
                With a background in design and a strong understanding of web technologies, I enjoy turning
                ideas into reality. Whether it’s building a simple landing page or a complex web application,
                I strive to provide the best user experience possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects,
                and contributing to open-source. My goal is to continuously learn and grow in the ever-evolving
                field of web development.

                                and manage their color history. The app also includes features for creating gradients,
                                switching between light and dark themes, simulating color blindness, and sharing colors
                                via a unique URL. It has an intuitive, user-friendly interface designed with HTML, CSS,

                            <p>This project involved building a responsive web-based calculator that can perform a wide
                                range of operations, from basic arithmetic to more advanced functions like square root,
                                exponentiation, and logarithms. The app also includes a memory feature, allowing users
                                to store and recall values. Additionally, users can toggle between light and dark themes
                                to personalize their experience.</p>

                                handling, and responsive design. It also gave me an opportunity to implement a
                                light/dark mode feature and explore how user preferences can be easily managed with
                                JavaScript. This project highlights my ability to build interactive and visually
                                appealing web applications with clean and maintainable code.</p>
